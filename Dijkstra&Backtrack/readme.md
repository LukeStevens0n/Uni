# Dijkstra and Backtrack solutions for a directed graph

These two programs take in a start and end node, the number of nodes in the graph, and a list for each node, which represents the distance from this node to each other node in the graph.

Both algorithms produce the same result (save for a input file for a graph with 1000 nodes), and this exercise's purpose was to show the efficiency of Dijkstra's algorithm when compared to a backtracking solution.
